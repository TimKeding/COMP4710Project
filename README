    there's a guard that the arguments are all about the same hero
    and there are no repeated files

    also, hardcoded on lines 87-92 are the options for the clustering

        NUM_IDOL_CLUSTERS is the number of highperformance clusters to highlight

        MIN_IDOL_CLUSTER_SIZE is the minimum size a cluster must be before it is
            even considered in becoming highlighted as high performance

        TARGET_IDX should be set to either WINRATE_IDX or SR_IDX

        TARGET_HERO should match the hero that you're providing as file input
