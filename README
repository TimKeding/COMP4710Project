genData usage

    python genData.py res/pc_eu.txt PC EU throw/eu

        res/pc_eu.txt
        - the source file
        - this is a file consisting of a list of Overwatch player usernames

        PC EU | PSN | XBL
        - query paramenters
        - if two are given, the script will query the server for pc users
                based with the provided region
        - if one is given, the script will query the server for console users

        throw/eu
        - output prefix
        - this is the prefix that output data files have
        - the resulting output can be found in the throw directory
                in the format eu_{heroname}

    this generates a dataset that can be given to arrayplay.py to mine and plot with

    multiple instances of this can be run simultaneously on differing source files

arrayplay usage

    python arrayplay.py out/us_ana out/kr_ana out/eu_ana out/psn_ana out/xbl_ana

    this program takes a list of input files to process, mine, and visually present

    there's a restriction that the arguments are all about the same hero
    and there are no repeated files

    also, hardcoded on lines 87-92 are the options for the clustering

        NUM_IDOL_CLUSTERS is the number of highperformance clusters to highlight

        MIN_IDOL_CLUSTER_SIZE is the minimum size a cluster must be before it is
            even considered in becoming highlighted as high performance

        TARGET_IDX should be set to either WINRATE_IDX or SR_IDX

        TARGET_HERO should match the hero that you're providing as file input

    arrayplay.py will create 80-ish pyplot graphs simultaneously
    ( the number matches the number of dimensions )

    if you have low memory, save stuff to disk before continuing
