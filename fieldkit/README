to get a ALL_HERO_STATS dict in the format

    reaper
        [   death blossom kills,
            souls consumed,
            ... ]

    ana
        [   biotic grenade kills,
            nano boosts applied,
            ... ]

    ...

    use this:

        from fieldkit.fieldkit import FieldKeeper
        ALL_HERO_STATS =FieldKeeper.getAllHeroStats

whenever you try to use a field you find:

    for f in fields:
        # --- use f --- #

    use this:

        for f in fields:

            f =FieldKeeper.getLibraryForm(f, heroKey)
            # --- use f --- #

        ---

        this will turn

            Card
            -> Cards

            Turret Destroyed
            -> Turrets Destroyed

            etc

        ---

        so fields used will be as accurate as possible
        for accurate mining
